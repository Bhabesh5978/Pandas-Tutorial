    "Since I've been working on a lot of Kaggle competitions, I use Pandas a lot. As you may know, Pandas (in addition to Numpy) is the go-to Python library for all your data science needs. It helps with dealing with input data in CSV formats and with transofrming your data into a form where it can be inputted into ML models. However, getting comfortable with the ideas of dataframes, slicing, etc was very tough for me in the beginning. Hopefully, this short tutorial can show you a lot of different commands that will help you gain the most insights into your dataset. "
